# Computer Hardware Time Series Analysis

This repository contains the code and materials for a time series analysis of a computer hardware dataset. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), time series modeling using ARIMA, model evaluation, and presentation materials.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this analysis consists of [provide a brief description of the dataset, e.g., features, time period, source].

## Project Overview

1. **Data Preprocessing**: In this step, we cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis, handling missing values, and ensuring data integrity.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We conducted an EDA to gain insights into the dataset, visualize trends, and identify patterns in the computer hardware data.

3. **Time Series Modeling**: We used the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model for time series forecasting. The model was tuned for optimal parameters.

4. **Model Evaluation**: The performance of the ARIMA model was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

5. **Presentation Materials**: We provided Jupyter Notebook code snippets and explanations for each step of the analysis, making it easy to understand and replicate the results.
